# USB-Encryption

## Objective

The USB Encryption project aimed to develop a Python-based tool for secure file protection on portable storage devices. The focus was on implementing cryptographic methods to safeguard sensitive data while providing a user-friendly command-line interface for key generation, file encryption, and decryption. This project enhanced my understanding of cryptography principles, file system operations, and secure coding practices, simulating real-world data protection scenarios in a portable storage context.


### Skills Learned

- Cryptographic implementation using Python's Fernet library
- File and directory manipulation in Python
- Command-line interface design with argparse
- Error handling and exception management
- Basic key management for encryption
- Recursive file processing


### Tools Used

- Python for developing the core encryption and decryption functionality.
- Cryptography library (Fernet) for implementing secure encryption algorithms.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction and script execution.
- OS module for file system navigation and manipulation.
- Argparse module is used to parse command-line arguments and create a user-friendly interface.
